### **Selected Domain:**
- **Web Development**

### **Problem Statement**

#### **Problem Statement:**
Campus Bridge ‚Äì Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform  
The aim of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical learning and practical coding skills by integrating both into a single platform. College Bridge serves as an academic learning management system (LMS) for students, faculty, and administrators. This platform will provide coding skill development modules alongside academic learning features, such as performance analytics, course tracking, coding challenges, and a job matching system.

#### **Use Case:**
The platform is designed to help students track their academic and coding progress, interact with faculty and peers, and gain job opportunities based on their coding performance. Faculty can manage courses, assignments, and discussions. Administrators have a global view of the platform, with full control over user roles and system management.

### **Abstract / Problem Description:**

**College Bridge** is a comprehensive platform designed to cater to the needs of students, faculty, and administrators in an academic environment. The platform integrates Learning Management System (LMS) features with coding skill development tools, enabling students to improve their theoretical and practical skills simultaneously.

Students can track their academic progress, enroll in courses, submit assignments, and participate in coding challenges. The **Coding** section features a live code editor (currently in development) and a challenge leaderboard, motivating students to improve their coding skills. Faculty members can create courses, manage assignments, and engage in academic discussions. Administrators have oversight of the entire platform, managing user roles, performance metrics, and system configurations.

By integrating job matching, real-time code collaboration, and academic tracking in one platform, College Bridge offers an innovative solution to learning and skill-building. The platform‚Äôs **AI-powered features** (coming soon) will help students accelerate their learning and career growth.

### **Detailed Tech Stack Explanation:**

If judges ask you to explain your tech stack in more depth, here‚Äôs how you can confidently explain each part:

---

**üõ†Ô∏è Frontend:**

- **React** is the core library for building the user interface, providing a dynamic and fast experience. It helps with seamless routing and UI component rendering for all sections: **Dashboard**, **Academics**, **Coding**, and **Leaderboard**.
  
- **Tailwind CSS** is used to design a responsive and clean UI. It allows for quick styling and customization, making the UI highly interactive and mobile-responsive with minimal effort.

---

**üîê Backend:**

- **Node.js** powers the backend, ensuring that the application can handle asynchronous events and manage real-time updates efficiently.
  
- **Express** is used for creating robust APIs, facilitating communication between the frontend and backend.

---

**üìä Database:**

- **Supabase** is used for both user authentication and database management. It provides a PostgreSQL-based database and built-in support for authentication (email-based) and real-time data syncing.
  
- The **database schema** stores critical data related to users (students, faculty, and admins), courses, assignments, coding challenges, and performance metrics.

---

**üíª Real-Time Code Editor:**

- The **Monaco Editor** is integrated into the **Coding Section** for real-time code editing with features like **syntax highlighting**, **auto-completion**, and support for multiple languages. Please note that the **code editor** is still in development and may not be fully functional at this time.
